Videogames Python Application made by Benson Lee
Started 5/05/2024 | Finished 14/06/2024

The password for Editor mode is "1234".

The password is not secure, and exists just to show what is possible in the application.
Viewer mode is identical to Editor but you cannot add or delete rows in the Table.
If you somehow delete everything there is a copy of the data inside the folder named
videogames.db copy.
